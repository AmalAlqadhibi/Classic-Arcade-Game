# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

> In this game, you are a Player and there are Enemies (bugs). The goal of the game is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
- To prevent colliding you can *move the player left, right, up and down*
- The enemies move at varying speeds so be careful :)
- if colliding happened, you will move back to the starting square.
Have fun!
